# Final Project Proposal

## What I want to make.
I want to make a little animation of a sprite moving. Im going to use this using multiple different types of code we use through out this semester. I wanted to create one of those scenario games where the user can interact with the characters and make them do things. I want to create a story that people can interact with. But as I was trying to do this it was going to take up too much time.

## Inspiration
My inspiration is animation itself. Week Five was also a big part of it.

## Problems
I am having a hard time will classes. I can not figure ou how to use multiple classes.
Just trying to figure out the code for this project is going to be hard. There is going to be a lot of code in this project and it is going to be overwelming. I am actually feeling the overwelmingness all ready. If I mess up on the code I need to be organized or I am going to have a hard time figuring out what I did wrong. I might get stressed out because it's not working, to the point where I will want to through my computer across the room. I would like to make sure that, that does not happen. So I need to be organized when working on this project.

## MY PLAN

-create characters(using photoshop = should take 2 days max.

-figure out the movement of the characters = 5 days max

-use the mouse tags to help create the interaction part between user. = 3 days max

- project touch ups = 2 days max

I'm going to work on this project for a couple of hours each day till the project is due. If I just sit down and do it, it won't take to long. Hopefully it does not take to much of my time.

## Whats done so far
I have the basic P5.js set up written down, and one of my characters is done.
