# Final Project Proposal

## What I want to make.
I want to create one of those scenario games where the user can interact with the characters and make them do things. I want to create a story that people can interact with. But I am going to use some of my brain to make it interesting.

## Inspiration
The scenario games that you see people playing on their cell phone is part of my inspiration for this project and from week 12 where you are able to make objects interact with each other.

## Problems
Just trying to figure out the code for this project is going to be hard. There is going to be a lot of code in this project and it is going to be overwelming. If I mess up on the code I need to be organized or I am going to have a hard time figuring out what I did wrong. I might get stressed out because it's not working, to the point where I will want to through my computer across the room. I would like to make sure that, that does not happen. So I need to be organized when working on this project.

## MY PLAN
-get backgrounds done(using photoshop. Then put it in using week 13 source material) = should take 2 days max.

-create characters(using P5.js) = should take 2 days max.

-create props(using P5.js) = 2 days max

(should not take to long for backgrounds, characters and props to be done)

-figure out the movement of the characters = 3 days max

-use the mouse tags to help create the interaction part between user. = 3 days max

- project touch ups = 2 days max

I'm going to work on this project for a couple of hours each day till the project is due. If I just sit down and do it, it won't take to long. Hopefully it does not take to much of my time.

## Whats done so far
I have the basic P5.js set up written down, three of my backgrounds are down and one of my characters is done.
