[" OOP interaction sketch"] https://sj134629.github.io/120-work/HW-12/)

1. I created a sketch that make objects interact with each other by using OOP.
2. Like normal, I went through the source materials. In my homework I started out just putting the basics in, like function setup and draw. Then I created the class for my boring looking spaceships. I created "this" variables that are suppost to go in categories within my class. I wanted my sketch to interact with itself as well as making the audience able to interact with it. So I created a function where the user is able to use the mouse. I was also able to make the spaceships move by creating a movement categorie within my class. I was trying to make it look interesting by combining some of the example we were given to help up. It turned out of
3. I had a hard time trying to make my spaceships look more like spaceships. I could not figure out how to draw a ship without ruining the mouse function. So my ships ended up looking like black and white squares.
4. I learnd how to combined different peices of code without ruining the code.
5. I did not use the github for help. So far no one has had any issuses in the past week.
