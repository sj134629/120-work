[" OOP sketch"] https://sj134629.github.io/120-work/HW-11/)

1. I made a sketch using OOP.
2. First I went through the source materals like normal. Then I started my homework by first adding the functions that I needed. After that I set up the canvas in the setup function and I set up the background color in the draw funtion. I had a couple of variables outside both functions. then I created a class to help organize everything that I wanted my fish to do. I used the constructor tag and inside the constructor tag I used "this" to create these little variables and to use them to make my fish move. Then I drew out the fish with in the catigories of the class. I made them move in another one of my class catigories my using my "this" variables.
3. This assignment was a bit challenging because I have used "classes" in the past in either javascript or python and my mind wanted to keep refering back to that. But what I did in the past was I used CSS and with CSS you would have the class name in the main script but the code for the class would be in a CSS page. It just confused me a lot.
4. I learned how to use the "this" tag.
5. I did not use the github for help. Last week there was someone that needed help because their code was not working. I suggested on possibly going through and spaceing everything out right. I do not know if that helped them. But hopefully it did.
