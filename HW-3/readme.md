["Hello World!" Sketch](https://sj134629.github.io/120-work/HW-3/)

1. This weeks homework was pretty easy for me because I have had some history with code. I went through the steps in the course website to create a "Hello World!" page. I used function setup(), function draw(), createCanvas(), background(), and text() to create it. I also wrote comments before each function.
2. First I read through the course website. Then I downloaded the empty-example file and coped it and pasted it twice. I renamed the two files. One that I renamed was name course-work and the other I named HW-3. I put those in my 120-work repo. I did everything I was suppost to do in the course_work file. Then I actually started my actual homework in the HW-3 file. In the HW-3 file there is a sketch.js file and that is where I wrote all of the code to create the "Hello World!" page. Once I wrote all the code that I needed I opened it in a browser using the index.html file to check if everything looked alright. When it looked good I went on the Github Desktop application to commited it to Github. I looked at it on Github.
3. I did not really have any problems. I did not go on the class repo to ask for help.
4. There were not any issues on the last homework cycle in the class repo. But there were some in this cycle. There was someone who was having trouble with getting there URL to work. I said that they might need to redue the code and make sure that they are committing it.
