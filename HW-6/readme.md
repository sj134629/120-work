[" Algorithmic sketch"] https://sj134629.github.io/120-work/HW-6/)

1. For my homework assignment this week I made a sketch using P5.js algorithmic code. I used some math and variables to create my sketch
2. My whole homework process is pretty much the same each week. First I go through through all of the source. Then I do the assignment. The first thing I did set up the sketch by putting in the setup() and draw() tags. Then I added variables outside of both the setup() and draw() tags by writing let because I use Atom and then I added a name to them. I also used the JS objects to help create a circle with different variables inside of it. In the setup() tag I created a canvas and added a purple background. In the draw() tag I activated the circle by using those inside variables. I liked the stroke effect and the effect of the circle changing different sizes when you moved your mouse. So I mixed them together useing the variables and all the math including the Modulo. I used the random() tag to help make the stroke and I used the map() tag to create the changing of the circles size.
3. For some reason this week's homework was much easier than last weeks homework. I did not really have any issues. It's weird and I do not know why.
4. I leared a lot about what you can do with the Modulo and what you can do with math. 
5. There weren't any issues on the Github and I did not need to use it for help at all this week.
