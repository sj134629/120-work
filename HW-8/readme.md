[" loop sketch"] https://sj134629.github.io/120-work/HW-8/)

1. I had to created sketch using loops.
2. What I did in the homework process was I first went through the source material. I picked out different kinds of loops and combinded, to make make the sketch I created. I used for and while loops.
3. I had a hard time just writing the code. I kept messing up and having to start over. I first wrote code that I thought was a loop. But it was not there right code. So I had to go through the source work again and figure out what I was going to.
4. I learned the different code to create loops and that it is kind of hard to figure out how to use it.
5. I did not use the github and there were not any issues on the Github.
