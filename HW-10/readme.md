[" Array/ Function sketch"] https://sj134629.github.io/120-work/HW-10/)

1. In this assignment I created a sketch using arrays and a function that I created.
2. I first went through the source materials. I used the array tag to create the lines. I use the random tag to change to color of the lines and the face. I drew the suns face in the function that I created. I used the line and the arch tag to make the suns glasses and mouth.
3. I had a hard time positioning everything because the canvas grid still is confusing for me.
4. I learned kind of where (0,0) is on the canvas and I learned how to use the function and array tags.
5. I did not use github for help. But there was someone that needed help this week but not last week. They were having a hard time getting their code to just work. Someone said that their semicolons were in the wrong place. But after They changed it, it still did not work. So I suggested maybe working on the spacing of everything. Hopefully that might help them.
