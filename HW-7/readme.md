# HW 7 | Describe then Alter the Bouncing Ball

## Description of What the Original Code is Doing


The sketch is working because every variable and function is put in the right place.

Line 3 is the main variable. The little variables in Lines 4-10 work together in the main variable. This is called a JavaScript Objects.
Lines 4 is the width of the circle variable. Lines 5 and 6 is the positon of where the mouse clicks/is on both the x and the y access. Lines 7 and 8 is the length and with of how far apart the balls are to each other. Lines 9 and 10 is the length and width of the canvas.
Line 12 is the setup of the whole sketch. Line 13 is what creates the size of the canvas. Line 14 is what creates the color of the background. Line 19 make you able to draw on the canvas. Lines 21 and 22  multiplys the amount of speed of the ball base on position of the mouse.
Lines 25 and 26 pretty much states that if the mouse get clicked closer to zero on the x-axis, the width the stroke of ball gets smaller. If it gets clicked farther than zero its width gets bigger. Line 28 and 29 pretty much states that If the mouse gets clicked closer to zero on the y-axis, the length of how far apart the balls are gets smaller. If it gets clicked farther than zero its length gets bigger. Line 32 is what changes the color of the ball. line 33 creates the shape of the ball. line 36 is the fuction that make you able to click the mouse and it will effect the change of the ball. Line 37 and 38 is what tracks the positon of the mouse.

In order to change the direction of the ball you have to click anywhere on the screen.

## How did you alter the sketch?

I pretty much changed the colors by going in to the fill tag and the background tag. I changed the height by going into the createCanvas tag. I also changes some of the numbers in the variable to change the look of the ball.
