["Moving sketch"] https://sj134629.github.io/120-work/HW-5/)

1. I had to create some sort of creature using p5.js code that was able to move and change over time.
2. I first went through all of the source materials before I started. I started out with the head. I made sure that the head would follow my cursor by adding the noCursor tag. Once I did that I used variables and other tags to create the body and the rest of the head like the face. The arms took me a little bit of time to do, but I eventually was able to make them rotate.
3. This project was pretty difficult. Especially when I had to restart multiple times and it took most of the day to do. It was very frustrating because if I did not put in the exact code, my creature would not show up or move. Sometimes I could not figure out what was wrong and ended up starting over. I think I started over at least four times. But I eventually figured it out. I did not go onto the Github to ask for help because I am stubborn and think that I will be able to find the answer myself. No matter how many times I have wanted to through my computer accross the room, I still managed to push through it and I finish it.
4. I learned that in order to make something move you need to write a lot of code.
5. There was no new issues for me to help with on the Github this week.
