["Portrait sketch"] https://sj134629.github.io/120-work/HW-4/)

1. I went through all of the source material in ithe course website. I created a portrait that is suppost to look like myself using code from p5.js.
2. I first went through all of the source material and tutorials in the course website. Then I went through the examples and picked things out that I needed to create my portrait. I first used rectangletags to create two rectangles for the head and neck. I rounded out some of the rectangles edges and rotated then the create a head shape. I did the same with the whites of the eyes. I also I adjusted the sizes and place of each shape. I used a rectangle for the back of the hair and mouth. I used the ellipses tag for the irises and puples of the eyes and the glasses. I used the line tag to connect the glasses and finsh the mouth. I used triangles to create the rest of the hair. Then I used the text tags to sign my name. This homework assignment was very time consuming.
3. I had a little bit of trouble figureing out the dimensions of the shape. But that was pretty much it. I figured it out through the p5.js website.
4. I learned some new tags that I didn't know.
5. There were not many issues on the github but I tryed to help someone last week on how to get there URL to work.
