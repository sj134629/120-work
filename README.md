## Assignment 1

1. In this assignment I went though all of the steps that were instructed in the course website to set up the Text documents, Text Editors and the GitHub desktop application.
2. The steps I took were, I read through everything in the course website step by step. I applied each step in order to set everything up. First I made the text document.Then I downloaded the apps that I needed. I when through the set up and synced the text editor, GitHub desktop, and GitHub together.
3. I had one problem. I had a hard time finding the prefrences in the GitHub desktop app because in the windows verison it does not have the GitHub desktop tab next to the file tab. I looked through the other tabs and still could not find it. I actually emailed Stephanie, instead of using the class repo. After that I thought I would try the options under the file tab and that actually trned out to be the prefrences. I found that out before I got a response from Stephanie. That solved the problem.
4. I learn that all of this is time consumming. Especually when you have a problem and it takes almost an hour to solve it.
5. I have not found out any issues that my classmates have had yet because this is one of the first assignments.
