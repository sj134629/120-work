 ### What my final is:
 So when I was thinking of what I wanted to do, I wanted to do something where the user could interact with it. So I thought it would be cool to do one of those japanese games where you pick an option and something will happen, or you pick a different option and something different will happen. But as I was try to write it out I realized that this project was going to take longer than expected. So I had to change my project to something a little more simple. So I created a wak'a'mole.

 ### The Steps I did:
 There was a lot of things that I did.
 1. First I went searching for how to make a spritesheet. It took me a bit, but I found out how to create one using Adobe Illustrator.
 2. I created a 6 frame mole.
 3. Then I went into Atom and put in the basic functions like function setup and draw.
 4. I created my canvas and changed the background color to green.
 5. I wanted to create a hammer to follow the mouse. So I drew it out first in the draw function.
 6. Then I translated the hammer to mouseX and mouseY to make it follow the mouse.
 7. After I did that I created ellipses in the background and made them look like holes for my moles to pop out of.
 8. Then I tryed to add my transparent spritesheet to my project by using the preload function.
 9. Once I figured out how to get my spritesheet to show, I went through the steps on how to make my sprite work in the course work in week 13.
 10. Once I finally figured out my sprite I create 9 copies of that one sprite and positioned them in the holes to make them look like they are coming out of the holes.
 11. I wanted to be able to be able to click on them and that would disappear. So I added a mousePressed function that made it to where I was able to do that.
 12. Then I wanted to make it to where my moles would come back randomly after I clicked them. I tried making a timer that would make it wait and then come back. But it did not work.
 13. That is pretty much all of what I did in this project.

 ### The many problems that I had:
 1. I had the hardest time figuring out why my spritesheet was not showing up. I made sure that I set up the files properly. I searched the internet but I could not figure it out. Then I went into Github and asked for help. But no one really helped. I tryed emailing the professor, but for some reason his email does not work. I emailed the lab assistants. But they did not answer me till after I figured it out. I ended getting help from my pass professor from a intro to programming class. I found out that I can't open it in chrome for some reason and I had to open it up in Firefox. I ended up having to download Firefox. I also figured out turning on my live site seemed to work.
 2. I also had a problem with making the mouse able to click on the moles and they would disappear. I looked through the course website and a lot of YouTube and I eventually figured it out.
 3. I had a hard time with getting my moles to come back after clicking them. It kept stopping on me. I went through YouTube and the course website like a mad man. I still could not figure it out. I put in another issue in the Github but no one helped. It got to the point where I went back and I asked the same professor that is not even part of this course and he responded back quickly. We both had a hard time figuring out what was going on. I ended up having to take out the timer all together and just leaving it how it is.

 ### What I learned:
 1. I learned how to problem solve a bunch without the help of the given resources. Expect for the course website. The course website helped a lot. Lets just say YouTube was my friend in this project. That professor was a lifesaver. I am so gratefull that he helped me and that he responded quickly.
 2. I learned how to make a spritesheet and how to make it work.
 3. I learned how to import an image.

 ### After thought:
 To be honest I am not sure why wak'a'mole popped up in my head. I just think of really weird things and my brain cells are slowly melting from so much stress. But lets just look past that. I think my favorite part out of this whole project was creating my moles. I liked drawing them in Illustrator and when I was able to bring them to life, I was so happy. I kept thinking in my head that they were so cute. That was the highlight of this whole project. I am so happy that it is done.
